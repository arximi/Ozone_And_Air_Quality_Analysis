# Ozone_And_Air_Quality_Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis of Ozone and Air Quality dataset using Python

## 📊 Overview
This notebook explores air quality trends using ozone and AQI data.

## 🗂️ Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from **DataCamp** as part of the  
☁️ [**“Cleaning Data and the Skies”**](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/competitions/cleaning-data-skies) competition.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the raw ozone dataset.  
- Analyze **trends** in ozone concentration and AQI values.  
- Identify **regions with consistently high ozone levels**.  
- Compare ozone readings across **different EPA measurement methods**.  
- Visualize ozone concentration and air quality distribution using **maps and charts**.

## 🧰 Libraries Used
pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, folium

## 🧩 Key Insights
- Ozone levels peak during summer months.
- Major metro areas show higher average ozone.
- Method variations slightly affect readings.
